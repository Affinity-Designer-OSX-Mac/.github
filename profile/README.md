## 📊 Overview  

Affinity Designer is a powerful vector and raster design application built for professional illustrators, UI designers, branding experts, and digital artists seeking high performance and creative freedom in a streamlined environment. Developed by Serif, it delivers advanced drawing tools, smooth workflows, and exceptional speed—making it one of the most responsive design platforms available today.

The software provides a dual workspace for vector and pixel editing, enabling users to switch instantly between precise paths and freeform painting without leaving the app. With its flexible toolset, you can develop logos, icons, UI layouts, posters, typography-driven artwork, concept sketches, and complex illustrations using a single integrated interface. Its highly optimized engine ensures real-time rendering of effects, transformations, brushes, and large documents without slowdowns.

Affinity Designer supports sophisticated vector manipulation, including Boolean operations, constraints, variable-width strokes, advanced snapping, isometric grids, and unlimited artboards. For raster editing, users gain access to brushes, textures, masks, blend modes, dynamic lighting, and pixel-perfect adjustments—ideal for hybrid artwork and texture creation.

The app is fully compatible with the Affinity ecosystem, offering seamless project handoff to Affinity Photo and Affinity Publisher for advanced editing, compositing, or layout work. Designers can export assets in bulk, create responsive UI elements, generate professional print files, or prepare layered exports for app and web interfaces.

With no subscription model, Affinity Designer is an affordable alternative to traditional industry tools while still providing professional-level precision, stability, and creative flexibility for modern workflows.
